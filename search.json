    "text": "Background\nI’ve moved to a new dwelling that has more or less difficult soils depending on patches, from the relatively soft lawn backyard to the hard compacted clay of the so called “nature strip”. I got a few cubic metres of compost for amending and improving the soils. One thing though is I was wondering whether this compost still had too much phosphorus (or even nitrogen for that matter) and may burn sensitive australian natives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis post is very empirical; I hope it brings useful information but I certainly make no claim about the relevance or completeness for the batch of compost your self may be dealing with. Anecdotally a friend had some compost batches from the same supplier than me that were foul smelling; she did not test the Ph but reported plants struggling in it for a couple of years.\n\n\n\n\nPh testing\nIf I get this right, a well composted organic mix should have a Ph near neutral. If not completely composted, the Ph may be alkaline, which may be an issue for natives which usually prefer slightly acidic soils (far from a blanket rule though - some originate from limestone soils after all). So what did I get with my big compost pile?\n\n\n\nPh testing compost\n\n\nThe Ph (using the Manutec soil ph test kit) seems to be neutral to slightly acidic, as advertised by the compost supplier. I’ve done just one sample from my 6 cubic metres mind you so far.\n\n\nNutrient content\nAustralian natives, in particular from the Proteaceae family are notoriously sensitive to soluble phosphorus. They’ve evolved in phosphorus poor soils and their roots may be burned by too much phosphorus. Note that nitrogen is usually less of an issue, however in an article “Slow-release fertilisers - You may release more than you realise”, Alan Lacey, RMIT University Chemistry (Retired) warns against urea based fertilisers that release too much notrigen, too fast. This is a one page article in the journal “Growing Australian - Australian Plants Society Victoria No. 254 December 2020”, but I cannot find a URL for it.\nAs I do not have the budget for a quantitative test on this compost, I instead have to put a tubestock in possible harm’s way and just see how it fares. I choose a banksia spinulosa, pretty plant and I just have to hope it will survive and thrive for years…\nRepotting is done in compost, mixed with washed sand to make sure there is adequate drainage. I do not want to mistake death by damp roots with phosphorus burn.\n\n\n\nSacrificial banksia April 7th\n\n\nA week after potting in, it seems unchanged, but it is too early to tell. There are a few yellow leaves at the bottom but they were present when bought from the nursery. In passing, it may be iron deficiency as these may have issues getting the iron they need.\n\n\n\nSacrificial banksia April 15th\n\n\nIt is now April 22 and the banksia is looking pretty much the same as two weeks ago. Finger crossed, but not out of the woods yet.\n\n\nNext\nWe will see how our banksia fares in later posts."
